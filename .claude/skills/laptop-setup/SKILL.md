# Fresh macOS Laptop Setup

This skill orchestrates the full setup of a new Mac. The bootstrap script (install.sh) has already installed Homebrew, 1Password, and Claude Code. This skill handles everything from here.

Run each step in order. Confirm success before moving to the next. If a step fails, diagnose and fix before continuing.

## Step 1: 1Password Setup

Ask the user to confirm they have done the following:
1. Opened **1Password** and signed in to their account
2. Enabled the **SSH Agent**: 1Password > Settings > Developer > SSH Agent

Then verify the agent socket exists:

```bash
test -S "$HOME/Library/Group Containers/2BUA8C4S2C.com.1password/t/agent.sock" && echo "OK: 1Password SSH agent is running" || echo "FAIL: SSH agent socket not found"
```

If this fails, tell the user to check 1Password settings. Do not proceed until this passes.

## Step 2: Configure SSH to use 1Password agent

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.ssh" && chmod 700 "$HOME/.ssh"
if [ ! -f "$HOME/.ssh/config" ]; then
  cat > "$HOME/.ssh/config" <<'SSHEOF'
Host *
	IdentityAgent "~/Library/Group Containers/2BUA8C4S2C.com.1password/t/agent.sock"
SSHEOF
  chmod 644 "$HOME/.ssh/config"
  echo "Created ~/.ssh/config"
else
  echo "~/.ssh/config already exists, skipping"
fi
```

## Step 3: Verify SSH access to GitHub

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com 2>&1 || true
```

The user may see a 1Password prompt to authorize the SSH key. Tell them to approve it. Expected output contains "Hi mcgizzle!". If it says "Permission denied", the user needs to add their SSH key to their GitHub account via 1Password.

## Step 4: Install Ansible

```bash
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
brew install ansible 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Step 5: Clone the home-server repo

```bash
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
mkdir -p "$HOME/code/personal"
if [ ! -d "$HOME/code/personal/home-server" ]; then
  git clone git@github.com:mcgizzle/home-server.git "$HOME/code/personal/home-server"
else
  echo "home-server repo already cloned"
fi
```

## Step 6: Run the Ansible playbook

This is the main event. It handles:
- Clones dotfiles bare repo to `~/.cfg` and checks out to `$HOME` (Brewfile, shell configs, Cursor settings, app preferences, etc.)
- `brew bundle` from Brewfile (all packages, casks, VS Code extensions)
- Zsh + Zim framework
- Git config (user identity, SSH known_hosts)
- macOS defaults (Dock right + autohide, fast key repeat, dark mode, en_GB locale, screenshots to ~/Documents/Screenshots, menu bar icon spacing)
- App preferences (Stats, AltTab, Rectangle, Itsycal, HiddenBar imported via defaults)
- Cursor editor settings (symlinked from dotfiles)
- Dotfiles-sync LaunchAgent (auto-backup every Monday 9am)

```bash
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
ansible-playbook "$HOME/code/personal/home-server/infra/ansible/laptop.yml"
```

If ansible-playbook fails on a specific task, diagnose the error and retry. Common issues:
- SSH key not authorized: user needs to approve the key in 1Password
- brew bundle timeout: re-run, it picks up where it left off
- dotfiles checkout conflict: backed-up files go to `~/.config-backup`
- `community.general` collection missing: run `ansible-galaxy collection install community.general`

## Step 7: Post-setup

Tell the user:
1. Open a **new terminal** to pick up the shell config (Zsh + Zim)
2. **Log out and back in** for macOS defaults to fully apply (especially menu bar spacing and Dock position)
3. Open **IntelliJ IDEA** and sign in to JetBrains account — Settings Sync will restore all IDE settings automatically
4. Set the `FIGMA_API_KEY` environment variable for the Claude Figma MCP server (get the key from Figma > Settings > Personal Access Tokens)
5. The dotfiles-sync LaunchAgent is now running — it auto-commits Brewfile and app preference changes every Monday at 9am
